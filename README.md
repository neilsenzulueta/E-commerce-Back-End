## Installation 

The following commands will help install the necessary packages for this application.

## Usage 

Once all packages are properly installed. Use command `mysql -u root -p` to access database in the command-line. User will need a MySQL account and a MySQL password. To seed the file run `npm run seed` then enter `npm start` to run the server. User will be allowed to view, create, update, and delete categories, products, and tags.
